# PWA Icons

## Required Icons

For production deployment, you need to add these icon files to this directory:

- `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels (optional, for iOS)

## Generate Icons

You can generate these icons using:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- Or create them manually using any image editor

## Development

The app will work without these icons in development mode, but you'll see warnings in the console. Add the icons before deploying to production.
